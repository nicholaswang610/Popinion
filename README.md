# Popinion
A web app (MERN) for posting reviews and ratings on gaming, music, book, and film products.

# Overview
This was my first full stack web development experience!  I'm planning on publishing this, but a redesign is in the works at the moment (check the bottom of this README).

If you'd like, the app can be run by typing "npm start" at the root directory (./review-it).  However, a lot of data will be missing since it's stored on a local mySQL server.  Instead, a couple screenshots from the web app can be found below.

# Plans for redesign!  

Before I publish this website, I want to modernize the UI and provide some more quality of life features!  I'm currently working on this but a draft of my ideas mapped out on Figma is below!
